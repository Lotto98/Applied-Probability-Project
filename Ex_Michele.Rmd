# Michele Lotto Exercises

4) 3.21
8) 5.22

## List 4 - Exercise 3.21
If A flips $n + 1$ and B flips $n$ fair coins, show that the
probability that A gets more heads than B is $\frac{1}{2}$.

Hint: Condition on which player has more heads after each
has flipped n coins. (There are three possibilities.)

### Solution

## List 8 - Exercise 5.22
Let U be a uniform $(0, 1)$ random variable, and let
$a < b$ be constants.

(a) Show that if $b > 0$, then $bU$ is uniformly distributed
on $(0, b)$, and if $b < 0$, then $bU$ is uniformly distributed on
$(b, 0)$.

(b) Show that $a + U$ is uniformly distributed on $(a, 1 + a)$.

(c) What function of $U$ is uniformly distributed on $(a, b)$?

(d) Show that $min(U, 1 - U)$ is a uniform $(0, 1/2)$ random
variable.

(e) Show that $max(U, 1 - U)$ is a uniform $(1/2, 1)$ random
variable.
